After installing Windows Subsystems for Linux (WSL), My VMware Workstation broke. This is how I fixed it:

Start VMware:
VMware Error 1: Module 'VPMC' power on failed.VMware Workstation does not support virtualized performance counters on this host.
 
VMware Error 2: You are running this virtual machine with side channel mitigations enabled. Side channel mitigations provide enhanced security but also lower performance.
To disable mitigations, change the side channel mitigations setting in the advanced panel of the virtual machine settings. 

Still not working? 
 
Delete WSL correctly:
1. setting> apps> delete> wsl 
 
2. on powershell: open termonal as admin> wsl -l -v #this should list all versions
Unregister: wsl --unregister <distro name> #you might have more than one
 
3. In Windows features> uncheck wsl and restart pc

Just in case:
On powershell:
Dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase
Dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
sfc /scannow
chkdsk /scan

WSL is uninstalled! Start VMware and... getting same errors. 
Why?
Virtualization applications don't work together with Hyper-V. This affects applications like VMware and Virtualbox when Hyper-V is running.
Another thing to keep in mind are security applications like Device Guard and Credential Guard that depend on hypervisor.
Next steps: Determine if Hyper-V-Hypervisor is running: searchbox> msinfo.exe > select System Information > See details for hypervisor
Why? by design. However, only one software can use Intel VT-x and AMD-V at a time. 
Disable Hyper-V:
In control panel > windows feature > deselect Hyper-V-Hypervisor
In powershell : open terminal as admin> Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-Hypervisor
Restart pc
 
Open run
C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Packages
Look for and delete the canonical and linux related folders
Can't? Is it running? Verify task manager. Can't see it? Verify procmon
Make sure in windows feature that you deselected WSL and Hyper-V and restart! 
Open run > C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Packages
Look for and delete the canonical and linux related folders
Delete it!
Restart

Open VMware and it works!
